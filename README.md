My dwm customization!

I personally made the statusbar (scripts folder) according to my preferences it could be modified in better probably. 

The icons are visibile only if you use a font that support them. 

For the shutdown and wifi options I made some (horrible) scripts with dmenu. 

## Notes
I'm using Fedora 41 workingstation so the dwm's start was a little more difficult, modifichesys.txt contains some info.
